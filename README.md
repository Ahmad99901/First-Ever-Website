#Project - Website

This is my first ever website coded with HTML/CSS. This is something I've been passionate about doing for a long time now and now I had the opportunity to design/buiild one. There is no specfic theme to this website as the main goal was simply learning and designing 
which is the reason why there is not a lot of content on other pages besides the home page. 

I achieved a high level of understanding of HTML/CSS just from creating this website project, how HTML is considered the body of text while CSS is the design/style for that body of text (HTML). I was truly excited when I accomplished creating this website, and obviously hoping to revisit in 2 years time to see how much I can improve the website around that time. Although it may not be as impressive as my future projects, this one will still hold a lot of meaning to me as this truly sparked my interest even further for different languages, learning and understandig how each function works.

. I created a search bar making it easier for Users to search for what they need
. A Navigation menu above that lets the user get around the website more easily
. A footer consisting of contact info 
. A logo on the left side of the navigation menu
. Tons of images to give life to the website and simply making it look cleaner
. Goals section mentioning what I hope to do achieve in the future!
